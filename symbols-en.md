The app only accepts plain text files (.txt). It does not accept file formats such as .pdf, .doc, or .docx (Word). If you have .doc or .docx files, you can open then on Word and export them to plain text format (.txt) before importing them into the app. If possible, choose the UTF-8 character encoding.

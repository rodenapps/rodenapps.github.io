title: How to restore a backup on Chords&Tabs/Lyrics+
---

To share or backup your songs, tap the button in the upper right corner of the screen. Then choose the option `Export Songbook`. All your songs are added to a zip file named `iPadSongs.zip`. It can take a few seconds, depending on the size of your songbook. When it finishes, you can send the file via email. If you prefer, you can connect the iPad to a computer, start iTunes in the computer, then copy the file using iTunes File Sharing (click on the `Applications` tab, then, under the section `File Sharing`, click on the icon for this app).

To import the songs into the iPad, you have to extract the .zip file in a computer, and then copy the resulting `.txt` files to the app using iTunes File Sharing -- see <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201301>.

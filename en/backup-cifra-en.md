title: How to restore a backup on Chords&Tabs/Lyrics+
---

## Full backup and restore

To backup all your data, including lyrics, set lists, and settings, tap the button in the upper right corner of the screen (![share button](../images/share-button.png)), then choose the option `Back up all data`. The app will create a file with all your data, which you can save locally, send by email, or upload to a cloud service.

To import the backup file into the app, tap the file and choose to open it with the Lyrics+ or Chords&Tabs app. The app will **replace** all your data with the data from the backup file. Be careful, because this operation cannot be undone.
 
## Sharing songs

Alternativately, to get a copy of your songs that can be open in any text editor, tap the button in the upper right corner of the screen (![share button](../images/share-button.png)), then choose the option `Export Songbook`. All your songs are added to a zip file named `iPadSongs.zip`. It can take a few seconds, depending on the size of your songbook. When it finishes, you can send the file via email. If you prefer, you can connect the iPad to a computer, start iTunes in the computer, then copy the file using iTunes File Sharing (click on the `Applications` tab, then, under the section `File Sharing`, click on the icon for this app).

To import the songs into the iPad, you have to extract the .zip file in a computer, and then copy the resulting `.txt` files to the app using iTunes File Sharing -- see <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201301>. The app will add the songs to your songbook.

This option does not allow exporting set lists.

<h1>Chords&amp;Tabs/Lyrics+ Manual</h1>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; color: gray;">Version 1.4.7</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Chords&amp;Tabs/Lyrics+ can be used with the iPad in both portrait and landscape orientations. When in landscape, the songbook is shown on the left, while the current song is shown on the right side of the screen. In portrait, the current song fills the entire screen. In order to <b>see the songbook</b>, tap the "Songbook" button, in the upper left corner of the screen. To begin, tap the option "All songs".</p>

<h2>Viewing songs</h2>

<p>To <b>view a song</b>, tap the song title in the songbook.</p>

<p>You can <b>skip to the next song</b> of the list by swiping your finger over the song lyrics, from right to left. It should appear an arrow on the right. Release your finger when the arrow is fully visible. The same logic can be used to <b>skip to the previous song</b>, however you should swipe your finger from left to right instead.</p>

<h2>Songbook</h2>

<p>The songbook can be displayed in many ways. By default, the songs are grouped by artist and sorted in alphabetic order.</p>

<p>You can try <b>other views</b> by tapping the button "View" (lower left corner).</p>
    
<p>To <b>delete a song</b> from the songbook, swipe your finger from left to right over the song title in the songbook and tap the button "Delete" that appears. Alternatively, you can tap the "Edit" button (upper right corner of the songbook). It should appear, on the left of each song, a red circle. Tap it to reveal the "Delete" button.</p>
    
<h2>Interacting with songs</h2>

<p>You can slide your finger over a song in order to scroll it in any direction. You can also <b>zoom in or zoom out</b> by making a pinch gesture with two fingers.</b>
    
<p>Other options can be accessed through the buttons in the bar above the song.</b>
    
<p>In public performances and rehearsals, it can be convient to use the autoscroll feature, that automatically scrolls the song from its beginning to its end in a specific time interval. To start autoscroll, tap the "AutoScroll" button, choose the song duration, then tap "Start". The song duration will be remembered the next time you want to autoscroll the same song. The scrolling stops when the song finishes. If you need to stop it before that, tap "AutoScroll", then tap "Stop".</p>

<p>You can change the <b>font face</b>, the <b>font size</b>, and the <b>contrast</b> of the song display by tapping the "aA" button. The contrast also allows you to make the background black (slide the control to the left), ideal for nightly performances. Changing the contrast in the app does not change the iPad brightness. For best results, adjust the brightness before adjust the contrast.</p>
    

<p>In Chords&amp;Tabs, you can also <b>transpose</b> the song, tapping the "Transpose" button. The notes that are shown correspond to the first note that appears in the song (not necessarily the key of the song).</p>
   
<p>Finally, to edit the current song (title, artist name or lyrics), tap the "Edit" button.</p>

<h2>Adding songs</h2>

<p>There are currently three methods of adding songs to the songbook: through the integrated text editor, through the iTunes application on the computer, or through a received email.</p>
    
<p>To <b>add a song through the text editor</b>, tap the "+" button, then choose "Through a Text Editor". In the window the appears, you should type the song title, the artist name, and the song contents. When you finish, tap the "OK" button (upper right corner).</p>
    
<p>If you prefer, you can access a web page in Safari (the web browser in iPad), select the lyrics, copy, go back to Chords&amp;Tabs/Lyrics+, then paste into the editor. At this moment, there is no convenient method to add songs from the web without exiting Chords&amp;Tabs/Lyrics+, given the copyright issues involved.</p>
    
<p>To <b>copy songs from a computer</b> to the iPad, tap the "+" button, then choose "From iTunes". Follow the detailed instructions that will appear.</b>

<p>If you receive an email message containing a song attached by Chords&amp;Tabs/Lyrics+, you can open the song using the Mail app in the iPad. The attached file must have the extension .rdm. Tap the file, then choose to open it with Chords&amp;Tabs/Lyrics+. If you want to know how to share songs by email, please read the next section.</p>

If you prefer, you can connect the iPad to a computer, start iTunes in the computer, then copy the file using iTunes File Sharing (click on the "Applications" tab, then, under the section "File Sharing", click on the icon for this app).</p>

<p>To <b>add the current song to a setlist</b>, tap the button in the upper right corner, above the song, and choose the option "Add to Setlist". Then, tap the name of the list.</p>

## What's New

Version 1.4.7 of Chords&Tabs and Lyrics+ was submitted to the App Store and is waiting for Apple's review. What's new:

```
This version fixes two bugs from last update:
- Prevents iPad screen from auto-locking
- Imports .rdm files copied from other apps
```

Meanwhile, you can configure your iPad's auto-lock timer. For that effect, open the Settings app, choose "Display & Brightness", then "Auto-Lock". Choose a high value, such as "15 Minutes" or "Never".

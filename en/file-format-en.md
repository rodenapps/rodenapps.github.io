title: File format for importing songs
---

To import a song's lyrics into the app, it has to be saved as a **plain text file** (`.txt`), containing the *artist name* and the *song title* in one of the following formats:

- The first line of the file is in the form `ARTIST NAME - SONG TITLE`
- The first line contains the `SONG TITLE` and the second line contains the `ARTIST NAME`

If you are exporting to plain text from a Word document (`.docx`), be sure to choose the option to end lines with carriage return and line feed (CR/LF).

**Valid examples**:

```
The Beatles - Hey Jude
```

```
Hey Jude
The Beatles
```

**Invalid examples**:

```
Hey Jude (The Beatles)
```

```
Hey Jude
```

(missing artist name)
